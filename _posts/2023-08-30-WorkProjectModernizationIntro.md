# Introduction
The Modernization Showcase project aims to provide a comprehensive record of my recent R&D efforts, focusing on aiding our company in migrating several key C# and Python projects to the popular cloud ecosystem(AWS, Azure). By presenting a practical demonstration of the migration process, including rewriting the C# components from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET 6, my goal is to showcase the transformative potential of adopting new technology stacks and cloud services to enhance our company's business operations. Hopefully, 

# Project Overview:
In an era of rapid technological advancements, it has become imperative for businesses to evolve their software systems to leverage the benefits of cloud computing. The Modernization Showcase project serves as a blueprint for this evolution, spotlighting the migration of core C# and Python projects to the Azure cloud environment. By embarking on this journey, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

* _Documentation of R&D Work_: 
The project will serve as a comprehensive repository documenting the research and development work undertaken during the migration process. This documentation will include insights into challenges encountered, solutions devised, and lessons learned, providing invaluable guidance to our teams.

* _Migration from .NET Framework to .NET 6_: 
A key aspect of the project involves rewriting the existing C# components from the legacy .NET Framework 4.8 to the more modern and feature-rich .NET 6. This transition will highlight the advantages of using the latest technologies to optimize performance, maintainability, and innovation.

* _Utilization of Cloud Services_: 
The project will showcase the integration of Azure services into our applications, highlighting the benefits of cloud-native capabilities such as scalability, reliability, and security. By adopting Azure services tailored to our needs, we aim to streamline operations and reduce maintenance efforts.

* _Enhanced Collaboration_: 
As an open-source initiative, the Modernization Showcase project will foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members. This platform will encourage the exchange of ideas, best practices, and innovative solutions, ultimately enriching the collective expertise of the entire organization.

* _Business Impact_: 
By successfully migrating our core C# and Python projects to cloud services, we intend to demonstrate how embracing modern technologies can lead to tangible business improvements. These enhancements could encompass increased agility, faster time-to-market, and improved customer experiences, thereby driving our company's growth and competitiveness.

# Library Dependencies:
One of the golden rule in software development is _*DO NOT REIVENT THE WHEEL*_. In this project, I will pick a few popular libraries, best visualized from below: https://github.com/MoienTajik/AspNetCore-Developer-Roadmap.
