# Introduction
The Modernization Showcase project aims to provide a comprehensive record of recent R&D efforts, focusing on aiding our company in migrating several key C# and Python projects to the popular cloud ecosystem(AWS, Azure). By presenting a practical demonstration of the migration process, including rewriting the C# components from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET 6, our goal is to showcase the transformative potential of adopting new technology stacks and Azure services to enhance our company's business operations.

# Project Overview:
In an era of rapid technological advancements, it has become imperative for businesses to evolve their software systems to leverage the benefits of cloud computing. The Modernization Showcase project serves as a blueprint for this evolution, spotlighting the migration of core C# and Python projects to the Azure cloud environment. By embarking on this journey, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

* Documentation of R&D Work: 
The project will serve as a comprehensive repository documenting the research and development work undertaken during the migration process. This documentation will include insights into challenges encountered, solutions devised, and lessons learned, providing invaluable guidance to our teams.

* Migration from .NET Framework to .NET 6: 
A key aspect of the project involves rewriting the existing C# components from the legacy .NET Framework 4.8 to the more modern and feature-rich .NET 6. This transition will highlight the advantages of using the latest technologies to optimize performance, maintainability, and innovation.

* Utilization of Cloud Services: 
The project will showcase the integration of Azure services into our applications, highlighting the benefits of cloud-native capabilities such as scalability, reliability, and security. By adopting Azure services tailored to our needs, we aim to streamline operations and reduce maintenance efforts.

* Enhanced Collaboration: 
As an open-source initiative, the Modernization Showcase project will foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members. This platform will encourage the exchange of ideas, best practices, and innovative solutions, ultimately enriching the collective expertise of the entire organization.

* Business Impact: 
By successfully migrating our core C# and Python projects to cloud services, we intend to demonstrate how embracing modern technologies can lead to tangible business improvements. These enhancements could encompass increased agility, faster time-to-market, and improved customer experiences, thereby driving our company's growth and competitiveness.

Conclusion:
The Modernization Showcase project represents a strategic effort to guide our company through the process of migrating critical C# and Python projects to Azure services. By meticulously documenting the migration journey, modernizing our technology stack, and leveraging the power of Azure, we aspire to set an example for our teams and underscore the immense potential of technology-driven transformations in boosting our company's business endeavors. Through collaboration, innovation, and dedication, we are poised to create a roadmap for success that not only benefits our organization but also contributes to the broader tech community.

Recently, I am working on prototying a couple of c# work projects into dotnet 6 new code base (dotnet Framework 4.8 web APIs, dotnet core old version web apps .etc). Aim is to showcase to the team some
